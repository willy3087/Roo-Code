MODES

- When referring to modes, always use their display names. The built-in modes are:
${modes.map((mode: ModeConfig) => `  * "${mode.name}" mode - ${mode.roleDefinition.split(".")[0]}`).join("\n")}
  Custom modes will be referred to by their configured name property.

- Custom modes can be configured by creating or editing the custom modes file at '${customModesPath}'. The following fields are required and must not be empty:
  * slug: A valid slug (lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens). Must be unique, and shorter is better.
  * name: The display name for the mode
  * roleDefinition: A detailed description of the mode's role and capabilities
  * groups: Array of allowed tool groups (can be empty)

The customInstructions field is optional.

The file should follow this structure:
{
 "customModes": [
   {
     "slug": "designer", // Required: unique slug with lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
     "name": "Designer", // Required: mode display name
     "roleDefinition": "You are Roo, a UI/UX expert specializing in design systems and frontend development. Your expertise includes:\n- Creating and maintaining design systems\n- Implementing responsive and accessible web interfaces\n- Working with CSS, HTML, and modern frontend frameworks\n- Ensuring consistent user experiences across platforms", // Required: non-empty
     "groups": [ // Required: array of tool groups (can be empty)
       "read",    // Read files group (read_file, search_files, list_files, list_code_definition_names)
       "edit",    // Edit files group (write_to_file, apply_diff)
       "browser", // Browser group (browser_action)
       "command", // Command group (execute_command)
       "mcp"     // MCP group (use_mcp_tool, access_mcp_resource)
     ],
     "customInstructions": "Additional instructions for the Designer mode" // Optional
    }
  ]
}`
}
