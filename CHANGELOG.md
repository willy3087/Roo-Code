## [1.0.8]

- Shows diff view of new or edited files right in the editor

## [1.0.7]

- Replace `list_files` and `analyze_project` with more explicit `list_files_top_level`, `list_files_recursive`, and `view_source_code_definitions_top_level` to get source code definitions only for files relevant to the task

## [1.0.6]

- Interact with CLI commands by sending messages to stdin and terminating long-running processes like servers
- Export tasks to markdown files (useful as context for future tasks)

## [1.0.5]

- Claude now has context about vscode's visible editors and opened tabs

## [1.0.4]

- Open in the editor (using menu bar or `Claude Dev: Open In New Tab` in command palette) to see how Claude updates your workspace more clearly
- New `analyze_project` tool to help Claude get a comprehensive overview of your project's source code definitions and file structure
- Provide feedback to tool use like terminal commands and file edits
- Updated max output tokens to 8192 so less lazy coding (`// rest of code here...`)
- Added ability to retry failed API requests (helpful for rate limits)
- Quality of life improvements like markdown rendering, memory optimizations, better theme support

## [0.0.6]

- Initial release
