# Change Log

## [2.1.6]

- Add LM Studio as an API provider option (make sure to start the LM Studio server to use it with the extension!)

## [2.1.5]

- Add support for prompt caching for new Claude model IDs on OpenRouter (e.g. `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet-20240620`)

## [2.1.4]

- AWS Bedrock fixes (add missing regions, support for cross-region inference, and older Sonnet model for regions where new model is not available)

## [2.1.3]

- Add support for Claude 3.5 Haiku, 66% cheaper than Sonnet with similar intelligence

## [2.1.2]

- Misc. bug fixes
- Update README with new browser feature

## [2.1.1]

- Add stricter prompt to prevent Cline from editing files during a browser session without first closing the browser

## [2.1.0]

- Cline now uses Anthropic's new "Computer Use" feature to launch a browser, click, type, and scroll. This gives him more autonomy in runtime debugging, end-to-end testing, and even general web use. Try asking "Look up the weather in Colorado" to see it in action! (Available with Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2)

## [2.0.19]

- Fix model info for Claude 3.5 Sonnet v1 on OpenRouter

## [2.0.18]

## [2.0.17]

- Update Anthropic model IDs

## [2.0.16]

- Adjustments to system prompt

## [2.0.15]

- Fix bug where modifying Cline's edits would lead him to try to re-apply the edits

## [2.0.5]

    - @url: Paste in a URL for the extension to fetch and convert to markdown, useful when you want to give Claude the latest docs!

- You can now edit Claude's changes before accepting! When he edits or creates a file, you can modify his changes directly in the right side of the diff view (+ hover over the 'Revert Block' arrow button in the center to undo `// rest of code here` shenanigans)

## [1.5.4]

- Adds support for reading .pdf and .docx files (try "turn my business_plan.docx into a company website")
