# Change Log

All notable changes to the "claude-dev" extension will be documented in this file.

<!-- Check [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) for recommendations on how to structure this file. -->

## [1.7.0]

- Adds problems monitoring to keep Claude updated on linter/compiler/build issues, letting him proactively fix errors on his own! (adding missing imports, fixing type errors, etc.)

## [1.6.5]

- Adds support for OpenAI o1, Azure OpenAI, and Google Gemini (free for up to 15 requests per minute!)
- Task header can now be collapsed to provide more space for viewing conversations
- Adds fuzzy search and sorting to Task History, making it easier to find specific tasks

## [1.6.0]

- Commands now run directly in your terminal thanks to VSCode 1.93's new shell integration updates! Plus a new 'Proceed While Running' button to let Claude continue working while commands run, sending him new output along the way (i.e. letting him react to server errors as he edits files)

## [1.5.27]

- Claude's changes now appear in your file's Timeline, allowing you to easily view a diff of each edit. This is especially helpful if you want to revert to a previous version. No need for gitâ€”everything is tracked by VSCode's local history!
- Updated system prompt to keep Claude from re-reading files unnecessarily

## [1.5.19]

- Adds support for OpenAI compatible API providers (e.g. Ollama!)

## [1.5.13]

- New terminal emulator! When Claude runs commands, you can now type directly in the terminal (+ support for Python environments)
- Adds search to Task History

## [1.5.6]

- You can now edit Claude's changes before accepting! When he edits or creates a file, you can modify his changes directly in the right side of the diff view (+ hover over the 'Revert Block' arrow button in the center to undo `// rest of code here` shenanigans)

## [1.5.4]

- Adds support for reading .pdf and .docx files (try "turn my business_plan.docx into a company website")

## [1.5.0]

- Adds new `search_files` tool that lets Claude perform regex searches in your project, making it easy for him to refactor code, address TODOs and FIXMEs, remove dead code, and more!

## [1.4.0]

- Adds "Always allow read-only operations" setting to let Claude read files and view directories without needing approval (off by default)
- Implement sliding window context management to keep tasks going past 200k tokens
- Adds Google Cloud Vertex AI support and updates Claude 3.5 Sonnet max output to 8192 tokens for all providers.
- Improves system prompt to gaurd against lazy edits (less "//rest of code here")

## [1.3.0]

- Adds task history

## [1.2.0]

- Adds support for Prompt Caching to significantly reduce costs and response times (currently only available through Anthropic API for Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3.0 Haiku)

## [1.1.1]

- Adds option to choose other Claude models (+ GPT-4o, DeepSeek, and Mistral if you use OpenRouter)
- Adds option to add custom instructions to the end of the system prompt

## [1.1.0]

- Paste images in chat to use Claude's vision capabilities and turn mockups into fully functional applications or fix bugs with screenshots

## [1.0.9]

- Add support for OpenRouter and AWS Bedrock

## [1.0.8]

- Shows diff view of new or edited files right in the editor

## [1.0.7]

- Replace `list_files` and `analyze_project` with more explicit `list_files_top_level`, `list_files_recursive`, and `view_source_code_definitions_top_level` to get source code definitions only for files relevant to the task

## [1.0.6]

- Interact with CLI commands by sending messages to stdin and terminating long-running processes like servers
- Export tasks to markdown files (useful as context for future tasks)

## [1.0.5]

- Claude now has context about vscode's visible editors and opened tabs

## [1.0.4]

- Open in the editor (using menu bar or `Claude Dev: Open In New Tab` in command palette) to see how Claude updates your workspace more clearly
- New `analyze_project` tool to help Claude get a comprehensive overview of your project's source code definitions and file structure
- Provide feedback to tool use like terminal commands and file edits
- Updated max output tokens to 8192 so less lazy coding (`// rest of code here...`)
- Added ability to retry failed API requests (helpful for rate limits)
- Quality of life improvements like markdown rendering, memory optimizations, better theme support

## [0.0.6]

- Initial release
