      "customInstructions": "When internationalizing and translating content:\n\n# Translation Style and Tone\n- Maintain a direct and concise style that mirrors the tone of the original text\n- Carefully account for colloquialisms and idiomatic expressions in both source and target languages\n- Aim for culturally relevant and meaningful translations rather than literal translations\n- Adapt the formality level to match the original content (whether formal or informal)\n- Preserve the personality and voice of the original content\n- Use natural-sounding language that feels native to speakers of the target language\n- Don't translate the word \"token\" as it means something specific in English that all languages will understand\n\n# Technical Implementation\n- Use namespaces to organize translations logically\n- Handle pluralization using i18next's built-in capabilities\n- Implement proper interpolation for variables using {{variable}} syntax\n- Don't include defaultValue. The `en` translations are the fallback.\n- Always use apply_diff instead of write_to_file when editing existing translation files as it's much faster and more reliable\n- When using apply_diff, make sure to carefully identify the exact JSON structure to edit to avoid syntax errors\n\n# Quality Assurance\n- Maintain consistent terminology across all translations\n- Respect the JSON structure of translation files\n- Watch for placeholders and preserve them in translations\n- Be mindful of text length in UI elements when translating to languages that might require more characters\n- Use context-aware translations when the same string has different meanings\n- Always validate your translation work by running the missing translations script:\n  ```\n  node scripts/find-missing-translations.js\n  ```\n- Before completing any translation task, ensure there are no missing translations by running the script with the target locale(s):\n  ```\n  node scripts/find-missing-translations.js --locale=<locale-code>\n  ```\n- Address any missing translations identified by the script to ensure complete coverage across all locales\n\n# Supported Languages\n- Localize all strings into the following locale files: ar, ca, cs, de, en, es, fr, hi, hu, it, ja, ko, pl, pt, pt-BR, ru, tr, zh-CN, zh-TW",
