# Roo Cline

A fork of Cline, an autonomous coding agent, with some additional experimental features. Itâ€™s been mainly writing itself recently, with a light touch of human guidance here and there.

You can track what's new at our [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md), with some highlights below.

## New in 3.1: Chat Mode Prompt Customization & Prompt Enhancements

Hot off the heels of **v3.0** introducing Code, Architect, and Ask chat modes, one of the most requested features has arrived: **customizable prompts for each mode**! ðŸŽ‰

You can now tailor the **role definition** and **custom instructions** for every chat mode to perfectly fit your workflow. Want to adjust Architect mode to focus more on system scalability? Or tweak Ask mode for deeper research queries? Done. Plus, you can define these via **mode-specific `.clinerules-[mode]` files**. Youâ€™ll find all of this in the new **Prompts** tab in the top menu.

The second big feature in this release is a complete revamp of **prompt enhancements**. This feature helps you craft messages to get even better results from Cline. Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s new:

- Works with **any provider** and API configuration, not just OpenRouter.
- Fully customizable prompts to match your unique needs.
- Same simple workflow: just hit the âœ¨ **Enhance Prompt** button in the chat input to try it out.

Whether youâ€™re using GPT-4, other APIs, or switching configurations, this gives you total control over how your prompts are optimized.

As always, weâ€™d love to hear your thoughts and ideas! What features do you want to see in **v3.2**? Drop by https://www.reddit.com/r/roocline and join the discussion - we're building Roo Cline together. ðŸš€

## New in 3.0 - Chat Modes!

You can now choose between different prompts for Roo Cline to better suit your workflow. Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s available:

- **Code:** (existing behavior) The default mode where Cline helps you write code and execute tasks.

- **Architect:** "You are Cline, a software architecture expert..." Ideal for thinking through high-level technical design and system architecture. Canâ€™t write code or run commands.

- **Ask:** "You are Cline, a knowledgeable technical assistant..." Perfect for asking questions about the codebase or digging into concepts. Also canâ€™t write code or run commands.

**Switching Modes:**
Itâ€™s super simple! Thereâ€™s a dropdown in the bottom left of the chat input to switch modes. Right next to it, youâ€™ll find a way to switch between the API configuration profiles associated with the current mode (configured on the settings screen).

**Why Add This?**

- It keeps Cline from being overly eager to jump into solving problems when you just want to think or ask questions.
- Each mode remembers the API configuration you last used with it. For example, you can use more thoughtful models like OpenAI o1 for Architect and Ask, while sticking with Sonnet or DeepSeek for coding tasks.
- It builds on research suggesting better results when separating "thinking" from "coding," explained well in this very thoughtful [article](https://aider.chat/2024/09/26/architect.html) from aider.

Right now, switching modes is a manual process. In the future, weâ€™d love to give Cline the ability to suggest mode switches based on context. For now, weâ€™d really appreciate your feedback on this feature.

Meet Cline, an AI assistant that can use your **CLI** a**N**d **E**ditor.

Thanks toÂ [Claude 3.5 Sonnet's agentic coding capabilities](https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/fed9cc193a14b84131812372d8d5857f8f304c52/Model_Card_Claude_3_Addendum.pdf),Â Cline can handle complex software development tasks step-by-step. With tools that let him create & edit files, explore large projects, use the browser, and execute terminal commands (after you grant permission), he can assist you in ways that go beyond code completion or tech support. Cline can even use the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create new tools and extend his own capabilities. While autonomous AI scripts traditionally run in sandboxed environments, this extension provides a human-in-the-loop GUI to approve every file change and terminal command, providing a safe and accessible way to explore the potential of agentic AI.

1. Enter your task and add images to convert mockups into functional apps or fix bugs with screenshots.
2. Cline starts by analyzing your file structure & source code ASTs, running regex searches, and reading relevant files to get up to speed in existing projects. By carefully managing what information is added to context, Cline can provide valuable assistance even for large, complex projects without overwhelming the context window.
3. Once Cline has the information he needs, he can:
    - Create and edit files + monitor linter/compiler errors along the way, letting him proactively fix issues like missing imports and syntax errors on his own.
    - Execute commands directly in your terminal and monitor their output as he works, letting him e.g., react to dev server issues after editing a file.
    - For web development tasks, Cline can launch the site in a headless browser, click, type, scroll, and capture screenshots + console logs, allowing him to fix runtime errors and visual bugs.
4. When a task is completed, Cline will present the result to you with a terminal command likeÂ `open -a "Google Chrome" index.html`, which you run with a click of a button.

> [!TIP]
> Use theÂ `CMD/CTRL + Shift + P`Â shortcut to open the command palette and typeÂ "Cline: Open In New Tab"Â to open the extension as a tab in your editor. This lets you use Cline side-by-side with your file explorer, and see how he changes your workspace more clearly.

### Use any API and Model

Cline supports API providers like OpenRouter, Anthropic, Glama, OpenAI, Google Gemini, AWS Bedrock, Azure, and GCP Vertex. You can also configure any OpenAI compatible API, or use a local model through LM Studio/Ollama. If you're using OpenRouter, the extension fetches their latest model list, allowing you to use the newest models as soon as they're available.

The extension also keeps track of total tokens and API usage cost for the entire task loop and individual requests, keeping you informed of spend every step of the way.

### Run Commands in Terminal

Thanks to the new [shell integration updates in VSCode v1.93](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_93#_terminal-shell-integration-api), Cline can execute commands directly in your terminal and receive the output. This allows him to perform a wide range of tasks, from installing packages and running build scripts to deploying applications, managing databases, and executing tests, all while adapting to your dev environment & toolchain to get the job done right.

For long running processes like dev servers, use the "Proceed While Running" button to let Cline continue in the task while the command runs in the background. As Cline works heâ€™ll be notified of any new terminal output along the way, letting him react to issues that may come up, such as compile-time errors when editing files.

<img align="right" width="400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5977833-d9b8-491e-90f9-05f9cd38c588">

### Create and Edit Files

Cline can create and edit files directly in your editor, presenting you a diff view of the changes. You can edit or revert Cline's changes directly in the diff view editor, or provide feedback in chat until you're satisfied with the result. Cline also monitors linter/compiler errors (missing imports, syntax errors, etc.) so he can fix issues that come up along the way on his own.

All changes made by Cline are recorded in your file's Timeline, providing an easy way to track and revert modifications if needed.

<img align="left" width="370" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc2e85ba-dfeb-4fe6-9942-7cfc4703cbe5">

### Use the Browser

With Claude 3.5 Sonnet's new [Computer Use](https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use) capability, Cline can launch a browser, click elements, type text, and scroll, capturing screenshots and console logs at each step. This allows for interactive debugging, end-to-end testing, and even general web use! This gives him autonomy to fixing visual bugs and runtime issues without you needing to handhold and copy-pasting error logs yourself.

Try asking Cline to "test the app", and watch as he runs a command like `npm run dev`, launches your locally running dev server in a browser, and performs a series of tests to confirm that everything works. [See a demo here.](https://x.com/sdrzn/status/1850880547825823989)

### "add a tool that..."

Thanks to the [Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol), Cline can extend his capabilities through custom tools. While you can use [community-made servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers), Cline can instead create and install tools tailored to your specific workflow. Just ask Cline to "add a tool" and he will handle everything, from creating a new MCP server to installing it into the extension. These custom tools then become part of Cline's toolkit, ready to use in future tasks.

- "add a tool that fetches Jira tickets": Retrieve ticket ACs and put Cline to work
- "add a tool that manages AWS EC2s": Check server metrics and scale instances up or down
- "add a tool that pulls the latest PagerDuty incidents": Fetch details and ask Cline to fix bugs
