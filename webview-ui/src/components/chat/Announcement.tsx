You must update the latestAnnouncementId in ClaudeDevProvider for new announcements to show to users.

As soon as an announcement is shown, the id will be updated in state. This ensures that announcements are not shown more than once, even if the user doesn't close it themselves.

					Claude can now use a browser! This update adds a new <code>inspect_site</code> tool that captures
					screenshots and console logs from websites (including localhost), making it easier for Claude to
					troubleshoot issues on his own.

					Improved automatic linter/compiler debugging by only sending Claude new errors that result from his
					edits, rather than reporting all workspace problems.

						<li>
							<strong>@problems:</strong> Add workspace errors and warnings for Claude to fix
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>@file:</strong> Adds a file's contents so you don't have to waste API requests
							approving read file (+ type to search files)
